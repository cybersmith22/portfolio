# Web Application

Included is the PHP, CSS, and MySQL code for my shopping website. The `without-Remediations` is what I built while I was first learning to program dynamic webpages. The `with-Remediations` is my fortified version of the same webpage. The full documents for each phase are available upon request from prospective employers or collaborators. 

## Dynamic Webpage

The `without-Remediations` was a semester long web application project in my CS3800: Web Development II course. Hosted on an Apache server and includes MySQL database backend. This dynamic web page processes form data, interacts with the database, manages cookies and sessions, and uses minimum security practices.

## Vulnerability Report

For my `with-Remediations` I used the same web application from my Web Development II course for the basis of my semester project in CEG4424: Security Attack and Defenses class. While this version of the webpage does include some security modifications inside the code, most of the vulnerabilities were fixed on the Apache server and SQL database backend. This project focuses on detecting, identifying, scoring, and addressing vulnerabilities found in the web application.   
   
This project was seperated into four phases:
- Phase 1: Creating a secure internal network between virtual machines

- Phase 2 & 3: Automated and manual vulnerability testing utilizing OWASP Risk Rating Methodology

- Phase 4: Remediation Plan
The scope of this phase included calculating the CVSS score, the cost of the remediation in man-hours, the amount of risk reduced by the remediation, and the remaining CVSS score after the remediation.

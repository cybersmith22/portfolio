# RAID Disks

## Overview 
RAID systems are used to improve performance and prevent data loss from hard drive failures. RAID stands for Redundant Array of Independent Disks. There are several common levels of RAID systems. RAID levels provide a different balance among the key goals: reliability, availability, performance, and capacity.

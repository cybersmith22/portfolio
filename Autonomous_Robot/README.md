# Autonomous Robot

## Overview 

This project was built in a team of five, Bobby Linger, Kevin Logemann, Nate Schrider, Missy Tomasiewicz, and Kaitlyn Smith. Our Autonomous Shopping Cart was a two semester long endeavor with the helpful guidance of our advisor Mr. Buck. The first semester of this project was the design phase and the second semester was the build phase. The scope of this project is to not only build a autonomous robot, but give us experience working as a team on a long-term project. 

## Part 1: Design 
Over the course of the Fall 2021 semester, as a team we outlined our design's:
- Objectives
- Assumptions
- Requirements
- Contraints
- Standards
- Functionality
- Impact
- Architecture
- Tradeoffs
- Test and Evaluation Plan 
- Timeline
- Risk Analysis
- Implementation Plan   

## Part 2: Build
Together we were able to create a robot that would move forward until an object was detected by the proximity sensors, at which point the cart would halt all movement. Once the object was out of view of the sensors, the cart would continue moving forward.

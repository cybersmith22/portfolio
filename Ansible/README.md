# Ansible 

## What is it?

Ansible is a tool used to automate IT functionality and configure a domain's infrastructure. For this project, I configured Ansible to create a single user. 

## Inventory

The `inventory.yml` file holds a list of all hosts and systems on a domain.

## Playbooks

Playbooks hold the automated configuration functions.
